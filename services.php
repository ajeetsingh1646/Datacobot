                <p class="lead">Tutorials and How-to guides are probably the simplest type of blog post you can work on. They are easy because they involve you talking about things you are already familiar with such as your product or service.<br> The most important thing when it comes to how-to guides is to break down your tutorial into the smallest steps and into the simplest terms. DonÃ¢ÂÂt assume your readers know what theyÃ¢ÂÂre doing Ã¢ÂÂ this is a tutorial, remember?<br> Think about your recent work, and you can probably find some great ideas for you to write a tutorial on. Our co-founder built the largest WordPress resource, WPBeginner, by following this exact same principle.

                    Similar to the point above, this one is even more generic. What do you enjoy reading about? What catches your eye? What will you talk to your friends about? Write about THAT!
                    <br/> News is always happening, from the latest Marvel movie to RussiaÃ¢ÂÂs latest antics. The brilliance of writing a post on current events is that people are already looking for more information and thoughts about these subjects. Your opinion post on current events could become the next viral sensation!
                    <br/> ItÃ¢ÂÂs even better if you can tie the current events with your product or service.

                    This type of blog post can be really fun to write, but remember to be wise. Controversy is always newsworthy Ã¢ÂÂ just look at the local news, theyÃ¢ÂÂre always reporting on different controversies!
                    <br/> You just need to figure out which controversy interests you, and how you can add to the conversation. Be sure to use the keywords around the controversy too. Mac vs. PC, MailChimp vs AWeber, Gun Control, etc. are just some basic ideas.
                    <br/> Since controversies are highly emotional, you want to be careful and choose your words wisely.

                    Checklists are simple to make. You probably make lists all the time such as your grocery list, supplies lists, to-do lists, etc.
                    <br/> All you have to do is take that same concept and apply it to your industry or blog.
                    <br/> If you are in real estate, come up with a checklist for an open house.
                    <br/> If you are in photography, write down your engagement session checklist to make sure you have all that you need for the perfect engagement session.
                    <br/> To perfect the checklist, take a common task and break it down into short, actionable items.
                    <br/> Next you can share that checklist to help others get started. Take a look at our content upgrade checklist.

                    People love hearing success stories and learning about what goes on behind the scenes. Case studies are fairly easy to write and are great for social proof.
                    <br/> Look through your customer list and determine which one has been successful in using your product.
                    <br/> Email your best customers, talk through how they have used your product or service to improve their business, and then share the case study on your blog. YouÃ¢ÂÂll be amazed how a single case study can inspire and attract tons of new customers.
                    <br/> HereÃ¢ÂÂs an example OptinMonster case study of how a Swedish website increased conversions by 800% using OptinMonster.

                    Much like a case study, you can write a profile post about anybody. You can write a profile post about an industry leader, your customers, or someone whoÃ¢ÂÂs up and coming in your industry.
                    <br/> The profile post should give some biographical information about the person and links where users can find more about them.
                    <br/> You can probably guess that you should put information on why you chose to write an article on this person, but also consider adding some facts that arenÃ¢ÂÂt well known so that your post can stand apart from any other resource.

                    You can perform an interview in a matter of minutes. Who is an important person in your area of interest that you believe would spark the interest of your readers?
                    <br/> Discuss with this person current events or get their ideas of whatÃ¢ÂÂs coming next in your industry. The goal here isnÃ¢ÂÂt just to have an interview, but to talk about things that your readers want to know about.
                    <br/> It could be business insights, lessons theyÃ¢ÂÂve learnt, sharing their expertise, etc.

                    If you want to post more on your website, but donÃ¢ÂÂt like doing videos, then you should consider podcasting. While you can definitely build your podcasting into a full show, you can begin with simple MP3s where you share your thoughts.
                    <br/> Just remember, as you build out your audio presence, you need to make it easier for your subscribers to tune in to your show. They may read your blog and check out your occasional MP3s, but you will likely want to eventually have a page on iTunes, Sticher, etc.
                    <br/> One of OptinMonsterÃ¢ÂÂs users, Michael Hyatt has an awesome podcast that I recommend you check out.

                    <br/> Whether it is toolsets, books, websites, whatever, compile a list of resources and share them with your readers.
                    <br/> Just be sure to give them more than just the name of the resource. ItÃ¢ÂÂs important to explain why you are recommending it.
                    <br/> You can even turn your resources page into a call-to-action like our co-founder Thomas Griffin has done on his website.

Do you know what it contained? 20 reasons, written as negatives, that actually highlighted the beauties of North Carolina. This funny post doesnÃ¢ÂÂt need to be related to your normal blog. This one is purely for fun.
